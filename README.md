<body>In 1985, our founders, Billy and Bille had a vision to create a top quality brand offering the very best in baseball products and services. Fueled by a love for the sport and a dedication to customer service, B&B's opened its doors on July 9, 1985. Selling only bats and gloves, Billy and Billie quickly grew their business to hire four employees by the end of 1985. Since then, B&B's has revolutionized the baseball product industry. B&B's is proud to be the recipients of several customer service awards, as well as the Best Place to Work in Indiana award in 2010. B&B established these three core values that we still hold to today:

<ol>
<li>Premier Customer Service
<li>Top Quality Products
<li>Commitment to Constant Improvement
</ol>
